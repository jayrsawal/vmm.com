        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Victoria Marie is unapologetically herself. Loud, proud, rebelliously curious and nothing but honest, she is truly a force to be reckoned with. A self-proclaimed beautiful-mess, she poses a challenge to her listeners and followers through her work, a mission of self-acceptance, expression and exploration. A child of the village, she&#39;s been uplifted by local communities throughout Toronto and raised to champion her differences as her strengths. Intentionally na&#239;ve, she expects the most from this world and these days she does not settle for anything less. 

        <p> Unrecognizable without her signature wide eyed smile and open-mouthed belly laugh. The youngest of four, and the loudest of all. A Filipina-Canadian. A goofball. A big kid, with even bigger dreams.</p>
